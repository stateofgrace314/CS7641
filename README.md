# CS7641 - Machine Learning
My repo for all assignments for CS 7641 - Machine Learning at Georgia Tech
Please don't copy my projects if you are taking the class.

# Environment
All development is done in a Linux environment using Docker. The Dockerfile and environment.yml are contained here, then the devcontainer info is stored within each project. To create the image for yourself, just use `docker build -t ml .` from this directory and it will create the image. Be warned, it will take a long time.

# Assignments
## Project1 - Supervised Learning
5 supervised learning models

## Project2 - Randomized Optimization
Testing out different randomized optimization problems and algorithms
